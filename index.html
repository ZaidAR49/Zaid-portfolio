       <p>The racing car game is a project developed using Windows Forms in Visual 
        Studio with C#. It allows players to switch their character from a car to other
         objects, like a ball, to create a varied gameplay experience. Developed in
          collaboration with a team from JUST University, the game was completed within
          two weeks. It features three levels, each with increasing difficulty to challenge
           players as they progress. The game combines intuitive racing mechanics with simple
            graphics, making it accessible and engaging for casual gamers. This project 
            demonstrates the team's ability to quickly develop a functional game, showcasing
             technical skills in C# and Windows Forms.</p>
